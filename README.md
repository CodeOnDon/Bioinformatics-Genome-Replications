# Bioinformatics-Genome-Replications
Studying "Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach" by Phillip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner and have added my own answers to coding challenges presented in the text book facing real world questions. I will be completed the coding challenges in Java and Python.

A well written and informatice book on the exciting world of bioinformatics and how biological questions can be tackled with computational strategies!

This repository will be covering code I have written for chapter one, "Where in the Genome Does Replication Begin?"
